        <h2>Process</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Step 1 - Strategy:</h4>
        <p>
          We'll engage in a 1x hour Skype strategy call with relevant key parties to discuss goals, the brand, important features and functionality, etc. We'll then go away and come away with a comprehensive website strategy, and design inspiration.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 2 - Design:</h4>
        <p>
          We'll put together a style tile, wireframe and homepage design that showcases the planned design and UX of the site for your review. This design will be optimised not just to be visually stunning, but to lad fast, be easy to update and maintain and planned with an understanding of the psychology of the user. This will take 1 - 2 weeks.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 3 - Development:</h4>
        <p>
          After you have reviewed and approved the design we'll get to work building it. We'll be building from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no clunky pre-built templates here). We'll conduct comprehensive browser testing, speed testing and website optimisation. This process will take around 1 - 2 weeks depending on the scope of the design that we agree on.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 4 - Review & Upload Content:</h4>
        <p>
          Now it's time to review the live site (on a hidden domain), upload all of your content (photos, images etc) and teach you how to use the content management system.
        </p>
